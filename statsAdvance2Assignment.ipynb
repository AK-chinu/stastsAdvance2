    "Consider a fair six-sided die. Let X be the random variable representing the outcome of rolling the die. The PMF for this scenario would be:\n",

    "To find the probability of a male being between a certain height range (e.g., 170 cm to 180 cm), you would integrate the PDF over that range. The integral gives the area under the curve between those heights, which represents the probability of a male having a height in that range."

    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a concept used in probability theory to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.

    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is one of the most widely used probability distributions in various fields due to its versatility and applicability to a wide range of phenomena.

    "Biological Measurements: Many biological measurements, such as heights, weights, blood pressure, and certain biochemical levels, often follow a normal distribution within a population.\n",

    "Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be closer to the mean, resulting in a narrower and taller peak.
